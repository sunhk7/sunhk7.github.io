    "## What is Diffusion Model?\n",
    "Diffusion models are a class of image generative neural networks inspired by and formulated as a simulation of the thermodynamic diffusion process. The core idea is to model the data generation process as a gradual denoising process, where a neural network learns to reverse a diffusion process that progressively adds noise to the data until it becomes pure noise. By learning this reverse process, the model can generate new data samples from random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SDE: Stochastic Differential Equations\n",
    "Diffusion models can be mathematically described using Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). @SohlDickstein2015DeepUL introduced the concept of diffusion probabilistic models, which can be viewed as a discrete-time approximation of continuous-time SDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic differential equation (SDE) in one-dimensional space can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$dx = f(x, t)dt + g(t)dW_t \\quad dW_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, dt)$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $x$ is the state variable (e.g., pixel values of an image).\n",
    "- $t$ is time.\n",
    "- $f(x, t)$ is the drift coefficient, representing the deterministic part of the evolution of $x$ over time.\n",
    "- $g(t)$ is the diffusion coefficient, representing the stochastic part of the evolution.\n",
    "- $dW_t$ is the increment of a Wiener process (or Brownian motion), which introduces randomness into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation describes how the state variable $x$ evolves over time under the influence of both deterministic and stochastic components. The drift term $f(x, t)dt$ captures the systematic changes in $x$, while the diffusion term $g(t)dW_t$ captures the random fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that when the deterministic component $f(x,t)$ is negatively correlated with the position variable $x$, the value of $x$ will gradually move toward the origin as time progresses. Meanwhile, due to the presence of the stochastic term, $x$ will eventually undergo random motion around the origin, following a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From SDE to Diffusion Models\n",
    "In diffusion models, the forward diffusion process can be described by a specific type of SDE. The SDE is defined as:\n",
    "$$dx = -\\frac{1}{2}\\beta(t)xdt + \\sqrt{\\beta(t)}dW_t\\quad dW_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, dt)$$\n",
    "where $\\beta(t)$ is a time-dependent function that controls the rate of noise addition over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $dW_t$ follows a Gaussian distribution, we can discretize the SDE over small time intervals $\\Delta t$ to obtain the following discrete-time update equation:\n",
    "$$x_{t+\\Delta t} = x_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(t)\\cdot x_t \\cdot dt + \\sqrt{\\beta(t)\\Delta t}\\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$$\n",

    "Let $\\beta = 1 - \\alpha$ in @eq-eq1. We can then derive the formula for $x_i$ corresponding to a given $x_{i-1}$. Since $\\alpha = [0.99999, \\dots, 0.999]$, at each time step, $x_{t-1}$ is scaled by $\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}$ and some noise is added. Because the noise follows a Gaussian distribution, conditioned on $x_{t-1}$, $x_t$ also follows a Gaussian distribution $N$. Then, a random sample from the distribution of $x_i$ is used as the input for determining $x_{t+1}$, and this process is iterated step by step. As a result, at each time step, $x_t$ moves closer to the origin. When $T$ is sufficiently large, i.e., there are enough time steps, the final $x_i$ follows a standard normal distribution: $x_t \\sim N(0,1)$.\n",

However, in subsequent steps, $x_{t-1}$ is sampled from a probability distribution, and $\\epsilon$ is also a stochastic value. The computation of $x_t$ involves combining these two uncertain values through scaling and addition. A single $x_t$ can correspond to infinitely many possible pairs of $x_{i-t}$ and $\\epsilon_t$. This means that the neural network would need to learn two uncertain values simultaneously, which is something the network cannot achieve.\n",

    "### What is reparameterization and Why use it?\n",
    "In deep generative models, we often need to sample from a probability distribution that depends on some parameters. For example, in diffusion models, a neural network predicts the mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ of a Gaussian distribution at each time step, and then we need to sample a variable $x_t$ from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sampling directly from this distribution can make it difficult to compute gradients with respect to the parameters during training. Suppose our neural network has parameters $\\theta$, and we want to compute the gradient of some loss function $L$ with respect to $\\theta$. If we sample $x_t$ directly from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\theta, \\sigma^2_\\theta)$, the sampling operation is not a function, which introduces randomness that breaks the gradient flow, making it impossible to compute $\\nabla_\\theta L$. The fatal problem is that the sampling operation is not differentiable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of the reparameterization trick is to seperate the randomness from the parameters by expressing the random variable $x_t$ as a deterministic function of the parameters and an independent noise variable. For a Gaussian distribution, we can express the sampling operation as:$$x_t = \\mu_\\theta + \\sigma_\\theta \\cdot \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$\n",
    "Here, $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, which is a random variable drawn from a standard normal distribution and independent of the parameters $\\theta$. This way, the randomness is isolated in $\\epsilon$, and the rest of the expression is a deterministic function of $\\theta$. It can be described by the following: $$x_{t} = \\mu_{\\theta} + \\sigma_{\\theta} \\odot \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can sample $x_t$ by sampling $\\epsilon$ from a fixed distribution (standard normal) and then applying the deterministic transformation. This allows us to compute gradients with respect to $\\theta$ during backpropagation, as the sampling operation is now differentiable with respect to the parameters, which $\\nabla_\\mu x_{t} = 1$ and $\\nabla_\\sigma x_{t} = \\epsilon$.\n",

    "## Reverse diffusion process\n",
    "In the process of forward diffusion, we defined how to gradually add Gaussian noise to the data using $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$. The reverse diffusion process aims to reverse this noising process, gradually removing the noise to recover the original data from pure noise by using its reverse conditional distribution $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$. If we can accurately model this reverse process, we can start from random noise $x_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ and iteratively sample $x_{T-1}, x_{T-2}, \\ldots, x_0$ to generate new data samples that resemble the original data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can we directly compute the reverse conditional distribution？\n",
    "In theory, if we have access to the true data distribution and the forward process, we can compute the reverse conditional distribution $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "$$q(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\frac{q(x_t|x_{t-1})q(x_{t-1})}{q(x_t)}$$\n",
    "However, in practice, this is infeasible for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unknown Data Distribution**: We typically do not have access to the true data distribution $q(x - 1)$. The reason is that we only have a finite dataset of samples from the data distribution, not the distribution itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intractable Integrals**: The denominator $q(x_t)$ is referred to as the marginal distribution of $x_t$. If we want to compute the probability at a specific time step $t$, we need to integrate over all possible previous states $x_{t-1}$:\n",
    "   $$q(x_t) = \\int q(x_t|x_{t-1})q(x_{t-1})dx_{t-1}$$\n",
    "This integral is often intractable, especially in high-dimensional spaces, which is called the \"curse of dimensionality\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these challenges, we cannot directly compute $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ and instead need to approximate it using a parameterized model, such as a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a neural network to approximate the reverse process\n",
    "We can use a neural network with parameters $\\theta$ to approximate the reverse conditional distribution. When the diffusion step size $\\beta_t$ is sufficiently small, the reverse process $q(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t)$ also follows a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, we can define the neural network outputs as the parameters of this Gaussian distribution:\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "p_\\theta(x_{0:T}) = p(x_T) \\prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) \\quad\n",
    "p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t)$ and $\\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t)$ are the mean and covariance predicted by the neural network for the reverse step from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is more, in the paper @ho2020denoising, the authors find that using a fixed covariance $\\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t) = \\beta_t I$ works well in practice, simplifying the model to only predict the mean $\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t)$, which is the main focus of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can train the neural network to learn the parameters $\\theta$ such that the reverse process $p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ closely approximates the true but unknow reverse conditional distribution $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$. To train the model, we aim to maximize the log-likelihood of the real data $x_0$ under the model, $\\log p_\\theta(x_0)$. Because direct likelihood optimization is intractable, we resort to Jensen's inequality and optimize the corresponding Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):\n",
    "$$- \\log p_\\theta(x_0) \\le \\mathbb{E}_{q} \\left[ \\log \\frac{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}{p_\\theta(x_{0:T})} \\right] = \\text{ELBO}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert each term in the equation to be analytically computable, the objective can be further rewritten to be a combination of several KL-divergence and entropy terms (See the detailed step-by-step process in @sohldickstein2015deepunsupervisedlearningusing):\n",
    "$$\\small \\text{ELBO} = \\mathbb{E}_{q} \\left[ \\underbrace{D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) || p_\\theta(x_T))}_{L_T}  + \\sum_{t=2}^{T} \\underbrace{D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) || p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t))}_{L_{t-1}} \\underbrace{- \\log p_\\theta(x_0|x_1)}_{L_0} \\right]$$\n",
    "where $D_{KL}(P||Q)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions $P$ and $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ is intractable, $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ is tractable because we condition on the original data point $x_0$. While $x_0$ is unknown at inference time, it is available during training as part of the dataset. Following the @eq-eq4 and @eq-eq5, we can derive the closed-form expression for $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ as a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\tilde{\\mu}_t(x_t, x_0)$ and variance $\\tilde{\\beta}_t I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our current goal is to have the neural network $p_\\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_\\theta,\\Sigma_\\theta\\right)$ approximate the true distribution $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\tilde{\\mu}_t, \\tilde{\\beta}_t\\right)$. Since the parameter $\\Sigma_\\theta$ is often fixed as $\\beta_t I$, we mainly focus on training the neural network to predict the mean $\\textcolor{red}{\\mu_\\theta}$ to be as close as possible to the true mean $\\textcolor{red}{\\tilde{\\mu}_t = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} \\left( x_t - \\frac{1 - \\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t}} \\epsilon_t \\right)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation means that to accurately predict the mean $\\mu_\\theta$, the neural network only needs to predict the noise $\\epsilon_\\theta$ present in the current image.\n",
